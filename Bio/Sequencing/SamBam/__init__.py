"""Fairly low level API for working with SAM/BAM files.

This is intended to be written in Pure Python (so that it will work
under PyPy, Jython, etc) but will attempt to follow the pysam API
somewhat (which is a wrapper for the samtools C API).

"""

class SamRead(object):
    """Represents a SAM/BAM entry, i.e. a single read.

    Paired end reads are described by two lines in SAM with the same
    template ID, and become two SamRead objects. Likewise a strobe-read
    or other mulit-read structure becomes multiple SamRead objects.

    This should be API equivalent to the pysam.AlignedRead object.
    """
    def __init__(self, data):
        r"""Create a SamRead object.

        This is a lazy-parsing approach to loading SAM/BAM files, so
        all the parser does is grab the raw data and pass it to this
        object. The bare minimum parsing is done - splitting the text
        into fields, for later parsing on demand if a property is
        accessed:

        >>> data = 'rd01\t...\n'
        >>> read = SamRead(data)
        >>> print read.tid
        rd01

        Note that a potentially unexpected side effect of this is that
        a malformed entry (e.g. a non-numeric mapping position) may
        not be detected unless accessed.

        Initially this will all be read only, but the plan is you will
        be able to set properties, and they will be held in memory and
        used in place of any prior value when writing the record back
        to disk. This will work by replacing the cached parsed value.
